# Cloud
**This is the code of a cloud which is programmed in javascript and uses firebase to store your data.**

**Step by step:**

1. Create a project in firebase: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

2. Enable storage in the firebase console

3. Replace the api key in the code with the one of your project

4. Replace the gmail username and password in the code (this only works with gmail)

5. Replace the receiver email adress in the code with the one you want the files you upload to be sent to

***You are done***


## What can you do with the cloud

* Upload every type of file which will directly be sent as a downloadlink to the specified receiver adress
* Change the code or use it in a bigger project (also change css)
* Use it commercially
